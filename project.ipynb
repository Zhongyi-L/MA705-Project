    "\n",
    "The data for this project comes from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI) database. Specifically, I use the indicator “Adolescent fertility rate (births per 1,000 women ages 15–19)” with the code `SP.ADO.TFRT`. The dataset is provided by the World Bank, an international financial institution that collects official statistics from national statistical offices and other international organizations and then publishes them in a standardized form on its open data website.\n",
    "\n",
    "**b. Format of the raw data**\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw data are provided as comma-separated values CSV files. The main file, `API_SP.ADO.TFRT_DS2_en_csv_v2_14702.csv`, contains a wide table where each row represents a country or aggregate region and the columns include country identifiers followed by one column for each calendar year (for example 1960, 1961, …, 2023, 2024). A second CSV file, `Metadata_Country_API_SP.ADO.TFRT_DS2_en_csv_v2_14702.csv`, contains country-level metadata such as region and income group. Both files are plain text CSVs that can be read directly into Python using `pandas`.\n",

    "The dataset is a panel (longitudinal) dataset that records adolescent fertility rates by country and year. For each country–year combination, the main variable is the number of births per 1,000 women aged 15–19. The time coverage starts in 1960 and extends to the most recent year available in the current download, with some missing values for certain countries or years. The geographic coverage includes most countries in the world, as well as several regional aggregates defined by the World Bank. The World Development Indicators are generally updated once per year when new national data become available, so the dataset is based on official, regularly updated statistics that are suitable for cross-country and over-time comparisons.\n"

    "## Dataset Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I use data on adolescent fertility rates from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI). The specific indicator is called “Adolescent fertility rate (births per 1,000 women ages 15–19)” and its code is `SP.ADO.TFRT`. I downloaded the data from the World Bank Open Data website, which is an official public data source provided by the World Bank Group. The World Bank collects and compiles these indicators from national statistical offices and international agencies, and then publishes them in a consistent format for researchers and policymakers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main raw data file is named `API_SP.ADO.TFRT_DS2_en_csv_v2_14702.csv`. This file is a comma-separated values (CSV) file. After skipping the descriptive header lines at the top, each row in the table represents one country or regional aggregate (for example a specific country such as Afghanistan, or a broader region such as “Africa Eastern and Southern”). The first columns identify the country and the indicator through fields such as “Country Name”, “Country Code”, “Indicator Name” and “Indicator Code”. After these identifier columns, each remaining column corresponds to a calendar year, starting from 1960 and continuing up to the most recent years (for example 2023, with an extra mostly empty column for 2024 in this version of the file). The cell values in these year columns are the adolescent fertility rates for that country and year, measured as the number of births per 1,000 women ages 15–19. Some entries are missing, especially for earlier time periods or the newest year.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also use a second CSV file with additional metadata for each country, called `Metadata_Country_API_SP.ADO.TFRT_DS2_en_csv_v2_14702.csv`. In this metadata file, each row again represents a country or region identified by a “Country Code”, and there are extra variables that describe the country. Important examples include the country’s “Region” (such as “Sub-Saharan Africa” or “Latin America & Caribbean”) and its “IncomeGroup” (such as “Low income”, “Lower middle income” or “High income”). There are also some text fields like “SpecialNotes” and “TableName”. Some columns in this metadata file are empty and will be dropped during cleaning. I will merge this metadata with the main indicator file using the country code, so that each observation has both the adolescent fertility rate and the region and income group information attached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the nature of the data is a panel (or longitudinal) dataset where the basic unit of observation is a country–year pair. For each country and each year, the main variable of interest is the adolescent fertility rate. The time coverage begins in 1960 and extends through the most recent year available in the current download, which allows me to study long-term trends over several decades. The geographic coverage includes most countries in the world, along with some regional aggregates defined by the World Bank. The World Development Indicators are typically updated once per year when new national statistics become available, so this dataset reflects official and relatively up-to-date information. Because the World Bank harmonizes the data across countries, the dataset is suitable for cross-country comparison and for analyzing how adolescent fertility evolves over time across different regions and income groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the analysis, I will first reshape the main indicator file from wide format (with one column per year) into a tidy long format where each row contains a country code, a year and the corresponding adolescent fertility rate. Then I will join this tidy dataset to the country metadata file so that I can compare adolescent fertility patterns by region and by income group, and use these variables later in visualization and modeling.\n"

    "\n",
    "To retrieve the adolescent fertility data, I first went to the World Bank Open Data website and searched for the indicator with code `SP.ADO.TFRT` (“Adolescent fertility rate (births per 1,000 women ages 15–19)”). On the indicator page, I used the CSV download option and saved the files `API_SP.ADO.TFRT_DS2_en_csv_v2_14702.csv` and `Metadata_Country_API_SP.ADO.TFRT_DS2_en_csv_v2_14702.csv` into a local `data/` folder inside my project directory. This initial download step was done manually through the browser and is not automated.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the files were saved locally, all the later steps were automated in the notebook using Python code. In particular, the notebook automatically locates the `data/` folder and reads the CSV files into `pandas` DataFrames each time the notebook is run. "

    "\n",
    "**a. Steps to transform the raw data into pandas DataFrames**\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw adolescent fertility data from the World Bank are initially stored as CSV files in a local `data/` folder. To work with these data in Python, I first loaded the CSV files into `pandas` DataFrames. For the main indicator file (`API_SP.ADO.TFRT_DS2_en_csv_v2_14702.csv`), I needed to skip four descriptive header lines at the top of the file so that the fifth line would be read as the actual column header row. I used `pd.read_csv(..., skiprows=4)` to achieve this.\n",
    "\n",
    "After reading the main file, I dropped an extra column called `Unnamed: 69`, which is completely empty and does not contain any meaningful information. The remaining columns include the country identifiers (`Country Name`, `Country Code`, `Indicator Name`, `Indicator Code`) followed by one column for each year from 1960 to 2024. Because this structure is in “wide” format (with one column per year), I reshaped the DataFrame into a tidy “long” format using `pd.melt`. In the long format, each row represents a single country–year pair, with one column holding the year and another column holding the adolescent fertility rate. I renamed this value column to something descriptive such as `Adolescent_Fertility`, converted the `Year` column to an integer type, and removed rows where the fertility rate is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the metadata file (`Metadata_Country_API_SP.ADO.TFRT_DS2_en_csv_v2_14702.csv`), I read it directly into a second DataFrame with `pd.read_csv`. I then kept only the useful columns (`Country Code`, `Region`, `IncomeGroup`, `TableName`, `SpecialNotes`) and dropped the empty `Unnamed: 5` column. Finally, I merged the tidy fertility DataFrame with the metadata DataFrame on `Country Code`, so that each observation includes both the adolescent fertility rate and the region and income group information. At the end of these steps, I obtained a tidy pandas DataFrame with one row per country–year, and columns for the country name, country code, year, adolescent fertility rate, region, and income group.\n"

    "To enrich the fertility data, I first read the metadata CSV into a pandas DataFrame and selected only the relevant columns, such as `Country Code`, `Region`, and `IncomeGroup`. I then performed a left join (merge) on `Country Code`, so that each row in the fertility dataset gained the corresponding region and income group values. This step created an enriched DataFrame (`df_tidy`) that combines the original fertility rates with the contextual information needed for analysis by region and income level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the merge was complete, I used `groupby` and aggregation operations to compute summary statistics. For example, I grouped the enriched data by `Region` and `Year` and calculated the mean adolescent fertility rate within each region–year combination. I also grouped by `IncomeGroup` and `Year` to examine how average adolescent fertility differs across income levels over time. These grouping and aggregation steps produce higher-level views of the data that are easier to interpret than raw country-level values and help highlight broader patterns and trends."

To make the column names easier to work with in Python, I created a cleaned version of this DataFrame with more explicit and consistent names in snake_case. For example, I renamed `Country Name` to `country_name`, `Country Code` to `country_code`, and `Adolescent_Fertility` to `adolescent_fertility`. This renaming step makes the code more readable and reduces the risk of typos.\n"
