## Overview

This website summarizes our MA705 Project 1 on global adolescent fertility (births per 1,000 women ages 15–19) using World Bank data from 1960 to 2023.

- **Data source:** World Bank World Development Indicators, indicator `SP.ADO.TFRT`.
- **Main question:** How have adolescent fertility rates changed over time across the world, and how do patterns differ by region and income group?
- **Key contributions:**
  - Cleaned and tidied adolescent fertility data into a panel dataset.
  - Enriched the data with World Bank region and income group.
  - Created visualizations to compare distributions, trends over time, and geographic patterns.
  - Fit simple regression models to quantify time trends and differences across groups.
